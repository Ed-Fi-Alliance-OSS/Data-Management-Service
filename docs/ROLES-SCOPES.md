# Roles and Scopes for DMS and CMS Applications

This document outlines the roles and scopes used in the **DMS** and **CMS**
applications, focusing on client registration, token generation, and access
control mechanisms.

## CMS Application

### Client Registration

When a new client is registered using the `/connect/register` endpoint in the CMS
application, the following defaults are automatically assigned:

**Default Role:** cms-client

**Default Scope:** edfi_admin_api/full_access

### Supported Scopes

| Scope Name                                      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `edfi_admin_api/full_access`                   | Provides **full access** to all API endpoints (read and write operations). |
| `edfi_admin_api/readonly_access`               | Grants **read-only** access to all `GET` endpoints.                        |
| `edfi_admin_api/authMetadata_readonly_access`  | Allows read-only access to the `/authorizationMetadata` endpoint.         |

> [!NOTE]
> Scopes define the level of access granted to a client. Assign
> appropriate scopes based on the clientâ€™s needs.

### CMS Role Usage

**cms-client:** This role identifies a standard CMS client. Currently, it serves
as an identity tag and may be expanded in the future to support additional
authorization logic.

## DMS Application

### Token Generation

Clients can obtain an access token via the `/oauth/token` endpoint.

The `client key and secret` used for token generation are generated by the CMS
application when a vendor application is created.

Stored in Keycloak as a client with the default role: `dms-client`.

### DMS Role Usage

**dms-client:** This role is assigned to all vendor applications by default.
Currently, the role is used only as an identity tag and does not enforce any
specific access control logic.
