# Simple Function Performance Comparison

## Overview

This document compares the performance of three simplified PostgreSQL functions designed to test the impact of different database design approaches on query performance. Each function creates only 2 temp tables (`temp_gender` and `temp_characteristics`) and returns 14 columns focused on core student data.

## Test Environment

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13 running in Docker containers
- **Dataset**: Northridge test data (21,634 students)
- **Test Method**: 10 iterations per function, measuring total execution time
- **Date**: September 17, 2025

## Functions Tested

### 1. sp_STUDENT_SIMPLE_Postgres (Original/Natural Keys)
- **Database**: northridge-flattened (same as others for consistency)
- **Approach**: Uses natural key joins with `studentusi`, `sexdescriptorid`, etc.
- **Tables**: Direct access to flattened tables using natural key columns

### 2. sp_STUDENT_SIMPLE_Postgres_Joins (Surrogate Key Joins)
- **Database**: northridge-flattened
- **Approach**: Uses surrogate key joins with `student_surrogateid`, `surrogateid`, etc.
- **Tables**: Direct access to flattened tables using surrogate key columns

### 3. sp_STUDENT_SIMPLE_Postgres_Views (Compatibility Views)
- **Database**: northridge-flattened
- **Approach**: Uses compatibility views (`vw_*`) that expose natural key interface over surrogate key implementation
- **Tables**: Access through views that translate between natural and surrogate keys

## Performance Results

| Function Type | Average (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | Row Count | Std Dev | Performance Ratio |
|---------------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Original (Natural Keys)** | **616.54** | **574.08** | **707.60** | 21,634 | 40.8 | **1.00x (Baseline)** |
| **Joins (Surrogate Keys)** | **587.42** | **547.04** | **692.27** | 21,634 | 41.3 | **0.95x (5% faster!)** |
| **Views (Compatibility)** | **1,152.14** | **1,083.75** | **1,337.73** | 21,634 | 70.2 | **1.87x slower** |

## Key Findings

### 1. Surrogate Key Joins Actually Perform Best
- **587.42ms average** execution time
- **5% faster** than natural keys on the same data
- Most consistent performance with moderate standard deviation
- **96% faster** than compatibility views

### 2. Natural Keys Have Comparable Performance
- **616.54ms average** execution time
- Slightly slower than surrogate keys (likely due to database differences)
- Similar standard deviation to surrogate keys
- **87% faster** than compatibility views

### 3. Compatibility Views Have Significant Overhead
- **1,152.14ms average** execution time
- **Highest overhead** due to view translation layer
- **87% slower** than natural keys
- **96% slower** than direct surrogate key joins

## Performance Analysis

### Why Surrogate Key Joins Perform Best
1. **Optimized surrogate key indexes** - BIGSERIAL columns with dedicated indexes
2. **Single-column joins** vs multi-column natural key joins
3. **Better query planner optimization** for surrogate key relationships
4. **Reduced index fragmentation** due to sequential surrogate key values

### Why Natural Keys Are Comparable but Slightly Slower
1. **Database difference factor** - original vs flattened databases may have different optimization
2. **Multi-column natural key complexity** in some joins
3. **Larger composite key sizes** requiring more memory for joins
4. **Still very competitive** - only 5% difference suggests both approaches are viable

### Why Views Have Highest Overhead
1. **Double translation layer**: Views translate natural keys to surrogate keys, then back
2. **Query plan complexity** as PostgreSQL optimizes through view definitions
3. **Additional I/O operations** for view resolution
4. **Memory pressure** from complex view execution plans

## Practical Implications

### For ETL Script Migration
- **Natural key approach**: Requires schema changes but delivers best performance
- **Surrogate key joins**: Moderate performance impact, requires code changes to use surrogate keys
- **Compatibility views**: Minimal code changes but significant performance penalty

### Performance vs. Maintenance Trade-offs
- **Best Performance**: Surrogate key joins (587ms) - optimal performance with modern schema benefits
- **Comparable Performance**: Natural keys (617ms) - very close performance but requires dual schema maintenance
- **Easiest Migration**: Views (1,152ms) - minimal code changes but significant performance cost

### Scalability Considerations
- Performance differences will **amplify with larger datasets**
- Views overhead becomes **more significant** as data volume increases
- Surrogate key benefits (referential integrity, smaller indexes) may **offset performance costs** in very large implementations

## Recommendations

### 1. For New Implementations
- **Use surrogate key joins** directly for best balance of performance and modern schema benefits
- Avoid compatibility views for performance-critical operations

### 2. For Existing Script Migration
- **Phase 1**: Deploy with compatibility views for immediate functionality
- **Phase 2**: Refactor critical scripts to use surrogate key joins
- **Phase 3**: Optimize further based on actual usage patterns

### 3. For Performance-Critical Scenarios
- Consider **hybrid approach**: Keep natural key optimized versions for high-frequency operations
- Use **materialized views** instead of regular views if view approach is required
- Implement **result caching** for frequently accessed student data

## Test Configuration Details

- **Hardware**: Docker containers on development machine
- **PostgreSQL Version**: 13
- **Memory Settings**: Default PostgreSQL configuration
- **Concurrent Users**: Single user testing
- **Cache State**: Warm cache (multiple runs)
- **Network Overhead**: Local Docker execution
