# Epic: Derived Relational Model

## Description

Derive a fully explicit relational model (schemas, tables, columns, constraints, indexes, views, triggers inventory) from the effective `ApiSchema.json` set, following the rules in:

- `reference/design/backend-redesign/design-docs/data-model.md`
- `reference/design/backend-redesign/design-docs/flattening-reconstitution.md`
- `reference/design/backend-redesign/design-docs/compiled-mapping-set.md` (unified `DerivedRelationalModelSet` shape)
- `reference/design/backend-redesign/design-docs/extensions.md`

This epic focuses on *model derivation* (not SQL emission yet). The primary in-memory deliverable is `DerivedRelationalModelSet` (see `compiled-mapping-set.md`), which is then:
- consumed by DDL emission (E02) to generate SQL, and
- consumed by plan compilation (E15) to generate dialect-specific CRUD plans (used by runtime and optional packs).

This epic also produces a deterministic `relational-model.manifest.json` suitable for snapshot/golden tests.

Authorization objects remain out of scope.

## Implementation approach (ordered passes)

The end-to-end build is orchestrated by `DMS-1033` as an ordered set-level builder over the full effective schema set (core + extensions).

- The per-resource derivation pipeline builds a model for one resource at a time (given a specific `resourceSchema` selection).
- The set-level builder executes **ordered passes**, where each pass iterates all projects/resources in canonical ordinal order and may consult any other resource/project metadata as needed.
- A story may contribute:
  - per-resource pipeline step(s) that derive additional per-resource model detail, and/or
  - a set-level pass that stitches/validates cross-resource artifacts, registered into the ordered pass list in `DMS-1033`.
