.SYNOPSIS
    Sets up the Ed-Fi DMS Configuration Service local Docker environment for E2E testing
.DESCRIPTION
    This script is a convenience wrapper that runs start-local-config.ps1 with the standard
    E2E testing configuration. It uses the isolated cs-local Docker stack (not dms-local)
    to match CI/CD behavior and avoid database contamination.
    
    The script runs:
    ./start-local-config.ps1 -EnvironmentFile ./.env.config.e2e -r
