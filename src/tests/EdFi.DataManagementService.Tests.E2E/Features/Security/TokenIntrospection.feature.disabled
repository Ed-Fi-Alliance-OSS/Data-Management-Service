# This is a rough draft feature for future use. Will likely need modification
# once we have determined more about how system interaction will work between
# the DMS and the OAuth provider.

Feature: JWT Token Introspection
    Other than the Discovery endpoint, all HTTP requests against DMS endpoints
    require a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authorizating the request. The DMS will
    perform self-inspection to confirm the validity of the token, rather than
    querying the OAuth provider.

        Background:
        # This might not be necessary - only keep it if other .feature files
        # are somehow bypassing token authorization. # Might need to provide
        # additional information here about # the allowed issuer and key
        # information for validating the signature.
            Given the Data Management Service must receive a token issued by "http://localhost"

    Rule: Discovery API does not require an authorization token
