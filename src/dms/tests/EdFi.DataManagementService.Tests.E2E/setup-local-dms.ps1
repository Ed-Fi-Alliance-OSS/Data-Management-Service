.SYNOPSIS
    Sets up the Ed-Fi DMS local Docker environment for E2E testing
.DESCRIPTION
    This script is a convenience wrapper that runs start-local-dms.ps1 with the standard
    E2E testing configuration. It is the companion to teardown-local-dms.ps1.

    Extension schema packages (Sample, Homograph) are loaded via DLL-backed SCHEMA_PACKAGES.
    The -AddExtensionSecurityMetadata switch activates Hybrid claims mode so extension
    claimset fragments are loaded from the AdditionalClaimsets directory mounted at
    /app/additional-claims. This is the non-bootstrap transitional path until Story 04
    moves E2E runtime loading onto the staged bootstrap workspace.

    The script runs:
    ./start-local-dms.ps1 -EnableKafkaUI -EnableConfig -EnvironmentFile <selected env file> -r -AddExtensionSecurityMetadata
