# Kubernetes Deployment

This folder provides a basic setup of a set of
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) files to setup a cluster.

## Local Development

For local development, you need to use
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

* After installing, run `minikube start` to setup minikube in your local
  environment.
* Set the docker environment inside minikube:

`eval $(minikube docker-env)` for Unix shells or
`minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell

* From the location of the [Dockerfile](src\Dockerfile), Build the data management service image:
`docker build -t local/edfi-data-management-service:latest .`

> [!WARNING]
> The [deployment file](./data-management-service-deployment.yaml#L21) has a policy
> of Never pull, which means that will use the locally built image instead of trying
> to pull the image from Docker Hub which is the default behavior, remove
> once the image is published to the registry.

* Set the terminal in the */deployments/kubernetes* folder.
* Create an app-secret.yaml file with a encrypted password, see [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
  for more information.
* Run `kubectl apply -f .` to apply all files.
* After done, inspect with `kubectl get pods`, and verify that all pods have
  status **RUNNING** (This can take a couple of minutes).

This will start the kubernetes infrastructure to run without exposing any
connection to the external network. When installing in a cloud provider the
clouds Load Balancing service will take care of making the connection to the
cluster, by opening a connection to the
[data-management-service](data-management-service.yaml).

This container has the type LoadBalancer, meaning that this is the entry point
for the load balancer provider.

To test this in the local environment, we need to open *tunnel* between the
local network and the Kubernetes cluster. To do so, run
`minikube service data-management-service --url`.

Copy the URL and connect to the Data Management Service.

### Useful commands

| Command                                         | Description                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------|
| `minikube start`                                | Start minikube cluster           |
| `minikube delete`                               | Clean minikube cluster           |
| `kubectl get pods`                              | Get all pods                     |
| `kubectl get deployments`                       | Get all deployments              |
| `kubectl get services`                          | Get all services                 |
| `kubectl describe service postgres`             | Get description of a service     |
| `kubectl exec -it POD_NAME -- psql -U postgres` | Execute a command in a pod       |
| `kubectl logs POD_NAME`                         | Get the log information of a pod |

> [!NOTE]
> In Kubernetes you can reference another pod by IP address or by hostname,
> where the host name is the name of the pod.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the moment, the postgres infrastructure is only for demo purposes and does not connect
> to the Data Management Service.
