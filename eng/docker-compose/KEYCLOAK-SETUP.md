### 1.  Create a `.env` file. The `.env.example` is a good starting point.

### 2.	This directory contains the `keycloak.yml` file which will create the container. To Perform the docker compose execution use the following command:

```pwsh
# Start keykloack
./start-keycloak.ps1
```

#### Note: 
If you want to shut down the container you can use the -d parameter and if you want to remove the volume, add the -v parameter.
```pwsh
# Stop keykloack, keeping volume
./start-keycloak.ps1 - d

# Stop keykloack and delete volume
./start-keycloak.ps1 -d -v
```
