# Data-Management-Service

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Data-Management-Service/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Data-Management-Service)

This repository contains two applications:

1. The Ed-Fi Data Management Service (DMS), which is a functional implementation
   of the following API specifications: Ed-Fi Resources API, Ed-Fi Descriptors
   API, and Ed-Fi Discovery API.
2. The Ed-FI DMS Configuration Service, which is a functional implementation of
   the Ed-Fi Management API specification.

These two applications and other services that support them are collectively
known as the "DMS Platform".

These two applications are being built to replace the legacy Ed-Fi ODS/API and
Ed-Fi ODS Admin API applications. The target time line for production ready 1.0
releases is Q4 of 2025. These applications and related documentation, startup
scripts, etc., are being developed under the code name "Project Tanager".
Tanager is just a project to get to 1.0; it is not a product.

See [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for a detailed tutorial on starting
the DMS Platform and interacting with it.

See the [Project Tanager](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Project-Tanager)
repository for detailed design documents.

See the [docs folder](./docs/) for additional developer-oriented documentation.
