# Contributors List

This is the list of the project's significant open-source contributors, not
including paid staff and contractors.

This does not necessarily list everyone who has contributed code, especially
since many employees of one corporation may be contributing. To see the full
list of contributors, see the revision history in source control or the [GitHub
contributors
graph](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Data-Management-Service/network/dependencies).
New contributors should add their name and e-mail address or link to GitHub
profile to this file with their first pull request.
