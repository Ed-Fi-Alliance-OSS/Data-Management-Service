- Completed: tasks.json#0 Algorithm subsection under "Integration Point + Pass Ordering" (DMS-1033)
- Decisions: single ordered list; explicitly lists fail-fast + pass mutations (Columns/Constraints/KeyUnificationClasses/eq-constraint diagnostics); inlines canonical+presence naming + hash formulas; explicit non-goals (no FK rewrite; FK derivation later in ReferenceConstraintPass)
- Files: reference/design/backend-redesign/design-docs/key-unification.md; tasks.json; progress.txt
- Notes: follow-up tasks likely: #4 FK responsibility/allowIdentityUpdates/ON DELETE wording; #3 make ref-membership detection rule normative for presence gating (SourceJsonPath lookup vs current "identity binding" wording)
